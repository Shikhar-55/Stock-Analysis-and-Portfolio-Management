# Stock-Analysis-and-Portfolio-Management

This project focuses on analyzing stock data and applying structured problem-solving techniques to make informed investment decisions and manage a stock portfolio. The project involves several steps and methodologies to understand the stock market, analyze stocks, and predict future stock prices. The findings and recommendations will be summarized in an executive report and presented to the investor through a video presentation.

### Preliminary Steps
In this stage, the data is loaded into the Python environment, and the entire dataset is merged into a single dataframe. The relevant columns are selected for further analysis. It is crucial to identify the company and the industry from the collated data for company-specific and industry analysis.

### Data Exploration
The data exploration phase involves creating visualizations and evaluating performance metrics to gain insights into the stock market. The analysis should summarize key information, such as trends, patterns, and performance measures. The findings should be supported by industry knowledge and facts.

### Stock Analysis and Portfolio Management - CAPM
As the portfolio manager, the responsibility is to create a portfolio of stocks that align with the investor's financial goals. The investor's profile is created using their information, and this is used, along with the obtained results, to select stocks for the portfolio. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is utilized to understand the expected returns and volatility of the stocks relative to the market. Other measures of technical analysis, such as the Sharpe ratio, can be employed to validate the portfolio selection.

### Stock Price Prediction - Validation
The portfolio manager needs to validate the results by leveraging machine learning models to predict future stock prices. This prediction is done for the stocks present in the portfolio. Based on the results, the portfolio's performance can be evaluated against the investor's desired outcomes. If the performance is satisfactory, the portfolio can be backed. Otherwise, alternative combinations of stocks can be explored to improve performance. Additional concepts associated with stocks, such as price and volume, can be used to derive new features that enhance the predictive model's performance.

Throughout the project, logical problem-solving approaches, data analysis techniques, and machine learning models are utilized to make informed decisions and provide valuable insights to the investor. The goal is to optimize the stock portfolio to achieve the investor's financial objectives and maximize returns.
